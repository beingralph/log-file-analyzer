# Log File Analyzer

This project is a simple **Python script** created to practice **log file analysis** for technical support tasks.  
It demonstrates how engineers can extract timestamps, identify recurring errors, and summarize results from log files to speed up troubleshooting.  

---

## 🔹 Features
- Extracts **timestamps** from log entries  
- Detects **ERROR** and **FAIL** messages  
- Counts **error frequency**  
- Works with any plain-text log file  

---

## 🔹 Files
- `log_analyzer.py` → Python script to parse and analyze logs  
- `sample.log` → Example log file with INFO, ERROR, and FAIL messages  

---

## 🔹 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beingralph/log-file-analyzer.git
   cd log-file-analyzer

2. Run the script
   ```bash
   python log_analyzer.py

3. Check Output:
-  Unique timestamps found
-  List of error messages with frequency

---

## 🔹 Debugging Steps

1. Load a log file into the script (sample.log or your own).

2. Review extracted **timestamps** to understand activity timeline.

3. Analyze **error summary** to find recurring or critical issues.

4. Use results to **prioritize fixes or escalate issues**.

---

## 🔹 Why This Project Matters

Support engineers often deal with **large system/application logs**.
This project simulates real-world tasks where:

- Logs need to be filtered for **errors**.

- Patterns must be identified quickly.

- A summary helps in **faster issue resolution**.

By practicing on this demo, one gains familiarity with **log analysis**, **regex**, and **automation in Python**.
